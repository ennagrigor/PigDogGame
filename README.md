## The Pig

Moves the object from one point to another. the user can choose in which
way the object will move on the x and y axis. The speed will slow down as the object gets closer to the endpoints.
- `Min Speed` - The minimun speed of the object. 
- `Max Speed` - The maximun speed of the object.
- `X Distance` - The distance of the object from its endpoints on the x axis.
- `Y Distance` - The distance of the object from its endpoints on the y axis.
- `Slow Down Distance` - The distance from the endpoint where the object starts to slow down.

## The Dogs

Rotate an Object. 
The user can add his own values to:
- `Position x, y, z` - Determine how the object will rotate on each axis.
- `Speed` - The speed of the rotation.

## The Finish Line

Increases and decreases the ball gradually.
The user can add his own values to:
- `Max size` - The maximum size the ball can reach.
- `Min size` - The minimum size the ball can reach.
- `Speed` - The speed at which the ball is decreasing and increasing.

## Animation 

Moves the ball in a circular form.
In order to move the ball around you can use the arrow keys (<- and ->)
The user can add his own values to:
- `Speed` - Determine the speed of the movement.
- `Radius` - The distance between the current x position to the center of the circle.
(The center of the circle is positionX + radius).
